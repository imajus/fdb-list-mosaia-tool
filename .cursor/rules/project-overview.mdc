# Mosaia Tool: FiloDataBroker Dataset Lister

## Project Purpose
This is a **Mosaia Tool** designed to list available datasets from FiloDataBroker. FiloDataBroker is a secure, decentralized marketplace for data trading, and this tool enables AI agents to discover datasets available for querying without requiring any input parameters.

## How Mosaia Tools Work
- Mosaia tools are serverless functions that extend AI agent capabilities
- They are deployed automatically when pushed to the `main` branch
- Tools are defined by a [.mosaia](mdc:.mosaia) manifest file that describes the tool's interface
- The main entry point is [src/index.ts](mdc:src/index.ts) which exports a `handler` function
- Actual tool logic is implemented in [src/tool-call.ts](mdc:src/tool-call.ts)

## Key Architecture
- **Handler Function**: Receives events, calls the tool function, and returns formatted responses
- **Tool Function**: Returns a structured list of FiloDataBroker datasets with metadata
- **Manifest**: [.mosaia](mdc:.mosaia) file defines the tool with no required parameters
- **Build Process**: TypeScript code in `src/` is compiled to JavaScript in `dist/` via [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)

## Current Implementation
- **No Parameters Required**: Tool returns all available datasets
- **Mock Data**: Currently returns sample dataset structure (needs FiloDataBroker API integration)
- **Structured Response**: Returns datasets with id, name, description, categories, size, provider, and access level

## Tool Registry
Once deployed, this tool appears in the Mosaia Tool Registry and can be added to AI agents to extend their capabilities with FiloDataBroker dataset discovery functionality.
